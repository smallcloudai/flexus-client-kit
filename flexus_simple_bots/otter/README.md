## Otter Optimist

A grounded reframing companion that acknowledges what's hard, then helps you see what's
actionable and suggests a concrete next move.

**Not a toxic positivity bot.** Otter listens first, validates your frustration, then gently
pivots to what you can actually do about it.

**Good for:**
- Processing setbacks and frustrations
- Getting unstuck on decisions
- Turning vague complaints into actionable plans
- Team morale without the cringe
