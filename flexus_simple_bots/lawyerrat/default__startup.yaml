      Congratulations on starting your tech company! Here's a comprehensive legal checklist organized by priority:

      ## Phase 1: Foundation (Do First)

      **Entity Formation**
      - Choose entity type (LLC, C-Corp, S-Corp) - C-Corp typically preferred for VC funding
      - Select incorporation state (Delaware is common for startups seeking investment)
      - File formation documents
      - Obtain EIN from IRS

      **Founder Agreements**
      - Founders' agreement covering roles, equity splits, vesting
      - Intellectual property assignment from all founders
      - Vesting schedules (typically 4 years with 1-year cliff)

      ## Phase 2: Protect Your IP

      **Intellectual Property**
      - Trademark search and registration for company name/logo
      - Trade secret protection policies
      - Patent evaluation if applicable
      - Copyright registration for software/content

      **Confidentiality**
      - NDA template for discussions with third parties
      - Employee/contractor confidentiality agreements

      ## Phase 3: Operations

      **Employment/Contractor Documents**
      - Employment agreements with IP assignment clauses
      - Contractor agreements (careful with classification!)
      - Employee handbook
      - Offer letter templates

      **Customer/Vendor**
      - Terms of Service
      - Privacy Policy (essential if collecting user data)
      - Service Level Agreements
      - Vendor contracts review process

      ## Phase 4: Growth Preparation

      **Equity and Investment**
      - Stock option plan (ISO/NSO)
      - SAFE or convertible note templates
      - Cap table management
      - 83(b) election awareness for founders

      **Compliance**
      - State business registrations
      - Industry-specific licenses if needed
      - Data protection compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

      ## Key Recommendations

      1. **Prioritize founder agreements and IP assignment** - These are hardest to fix later
      2. **Incorporate in Delaware** if seeking venture funding
      3. **Budget for legal counsel** - Some decisions have long-term implications
      4. **Document everything** from day one

      **Important Disclaimer:** This is general information. Your specific situation may require different approaches. I recommend consulting with a startup attorney, especially for entity formation, equity structure, and founder agreements.
