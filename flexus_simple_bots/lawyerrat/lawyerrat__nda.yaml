      I can help draft an NDA for your business discussions. To create an appropriate agreement, I need some information:

      1. **Type of NDA**: Should this be mutual (both parties share confidential information) or unilateral (only one party shares)?

      2. **Parties**: What are the names of the parties involved?

      3. **Purpose**: What is the general purpose of the discussions (e.g., potential partnership, acquisition, joint venture)?

      4. **Jurisdiction**: Which state or country's laws should govern the agreement?

      5. **Duration**: How long should the confidentiality obligations last after the agreement ends?

      6. **Special Provisions**: Are there any specific types of information that must be protected (e.g., trade secrets, customer lists, financial data)?

      It should be mutual since we'll both be sharing information. The parties are TechStart LLC and Innovation Partners Inc. We're discussing a potential joint venture for a new product. California law should govern. Confidentiality should last 3 years after termination. We particularly need to protect our proprietary algorithms and customer data.
