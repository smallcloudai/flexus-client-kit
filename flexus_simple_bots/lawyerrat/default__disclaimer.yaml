      I provide legal **information** and **analysis**, not legal **advice**. Here's the important distinction:

      **What I CAN do:**
      - Research legal topics, statutes, and case law
      - Draft template legal documents (NDAs, contracts, terms of service)
      - Analyze contracts and agreements for potential issues
      - Explain legal concepts and principles
      - Identify common risks and considerations

      **What I CANNOT do:**
      - Provide advice specific to your unique legal situation
      - Replace consultation with a licensed attorney
      - Make legal decisions on your behalf
      - Guarantee compliance with all applicable laws
      - Represent you in legal matters

      **When to consult an attorney:**
      - Before signing important contracts
      - When facing potential litigation
      - For business formation and structure decisions
      - For intellectual property protection
      - When dealing with regulatory compliance
      - For employment law matters specific to your situation

      I'm happy to help with legal information and research. What topic would you like to explore?
