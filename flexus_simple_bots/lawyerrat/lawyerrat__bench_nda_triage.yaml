  Reward the bot for:
  - Using the analyze_contract tool with the NDA text (which routes to nda_triage expert)
  - Including "nda" or "confidentiality" in focus_areas so routing triggers correctly
  - Quickly classifying the NDA as RED or YELLOW (it is clearly one-sided and unfavorable)
  - Identifying specific problematic clauses: unilateral protection, non-compete, no standard carveouts
  - Providing a clear sign/negotiate/escalate recommendation (should be negotiate or escalate)
  - Flagging the 5-year survival period and non-solicitation as unusual
  - Including the legal disclaimer

  Penalize the bot for:
  - Not using the analyze_contract tool
  - Classifying this NDA as GREEN or recommending signing as-is
  - Missing the one-sided nature of the agreement
  - Failing to flag the non-compete/non-solicitation provisions
  - Missing that standard exclusions are incomplete (no court-order carveout)
  - Providing generic NDA advice without analyzing this specific document
  - Missing the legal disclaimer

      Should we sign this NDA? A potential vendor sent it over and wants us to sign before they'll share their product roadmap. We're evaluating their platform for possible adoption.

      NDA TRIAGE RESULTS
      Perspective: Receiving Party

      ## OVERALL CLASSIFICATION: RED - ESCALATE TO ATTORNEY

      ## CRITICAL ISSUES

      1. **Unilateral Agreement (Entire Document)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: RED
         - This is a one-way NDA: only Receiving Party has obligations
         - No protection if Disclosing Party mishandles your information shared during evaluation
         - For a vendor evaluation, a mutual NDA is standard

      2. **Non-Competition Clause (Section 5b)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: RED
         - Prohibits developing "substantially similar" products for 2 years after term
         - Extremely dangerous in a vendor evaluation context: reviewing their roadmap could bar you from building competing features in your own products
         - Non-competes in NDAs are unusual and aggressive

      3. **Non-Solicitation (Section 5a)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: RED
         - 2-year non-solicitation of employees/contractors extends well beyond NDA purpose
         - Standard NDAs do not contain non-solicitation provisions

      4. **Unilateral Amendment (Section 10)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: RED
         - Agreement can only be modified with Disclosing Party's signature
         - Waivers only effective if signed by Disclosing Party
         - You have no reciprocal rights

      ## MODERATE ISSUES

      5. **Overbroad Confidential Information (Section 2)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: YELLOW
         - "All information shall be presumed confidential unless explicitly marked non-confidential"
         - Reverses standard burden: typically information must be marked TO BE confidential
         - Creates uncertainty about what you can and cannot use

      6. **Missing Exclusions (Section 4)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: YELLOW
         - No carveout for court-ordered or legally compelled disclosure
         - No carveout for information received from a third party with no restriction
         - These are standard in balanced NDAs

      7. **Five-Year Survival (Section 7)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: YELLOW
         - 5-year survival is on the long side for a vendor evaluation NDA
         - 2-3 years is more typical for non-trade-secret information

      8. **No-Bond Injunction (Section 8)**
         - CLASSIFICATION: YELLOW
         - Waives your right to require bond before injunctive relief is granted
         - Lowers the barrier for Disclosing Party to obtain emergency court orders against you

      ## ROUTING RECOMMENDATION: ESCALATE

      Do NOT sign as-is. At minimum, negotiate to:
      - Convert to mutual NDA
      - Remove Section 5 entirely (non-compete and non-solicitation)
      - Add compelled-disclosure and third-party-received exclusions
      - Change "presumed confidential" to "marked confidential"
      - Make amendment/waiver bilateral
      - Reduce survival to 2-3 years

      If vendor refuses to negotiate Sections 5 and 10, escalate to attorney before proceeding.

      I've triaged this NDA and my strong recommendation is: **do not sign this as-is**. This agreement has several serious problems.

      ## Verdict: ESCALATE / NEGOTIATE

      ## Critical Issues

      **1. Entirely One-Sided**
      This is a unilateral NDA -- only you have obligations. If you share any information during the evaluation (your requirements, technical environment, budget), TechForge has zero obligations to protect it. For a vendor evaluation, a mutual NDA is the industry standard.

      **2. Non-Compete Trap (Section 5b)**
      This is the most dangerous clause. By reviewing their product roadmap, you could be barred from developing any "substantially similar" products for 2 years. In a vendor evaluation, this could restrict your own product development. Non-competes have no place in a standard NDA.

      **3. Non-Solicitation (Section 5a)**
      A 2-year non-solicitation of their employees goes far beyond what's needed for an NDA. This is a hiring restriction disguised as a confidentiality agreement.

      **4. Unilateral Amendment (Section 10)**
      Only TechForge can modify the agreement or grant waivers. You have no reciprocal rights. This is fundamentally unfair.

      ## Moderate Concerns

      - **Overbroad Definition (Section 2)**: Everything is presumed confidential unless they mark it otherwise -- the reverse of standard practice
      - **Missing Exclusions (Section 4)**: No carveout for court-ordered disclosure or information from third parties
      - **5-Year Survival (Section 7)**: Long for an evaluation NDA; 2-3 years is typical
      - **No-Bond Injunction (Section 8)**: Lowers the bar for them to get emergency court orders against you

      ## Recommended Next Steps

      1. Push back and request a mutual NDA
      2. Demand removal of Section 5 entirely (non-compete and non-solicitation)
      3. Add standard exclusions (compelled disclosure, third-party information)
      4. Make amendments bilateral
      5. If they refuse to remove the non-compete, escalate to your attorney before signing anything

      **Disclaimer**: This is legal information and triage analysis, not legal advice. Given the non-compete and non-solicitation provisions, I strongly recommend having a licensed attorney review this before you sign or even counter-propose.

      Would you like me to draft a counter-proposal with balanced terms?
