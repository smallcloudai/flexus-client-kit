      CONTRACT ANALYSIS RESULTS
      Perspective: Client Corp

      ## HIGH RISK ISSUES

      1. **Broad Liability Waiver (Section 5)**
         - RISK: Complete waiver of vendor liability is extremely one-sided
         - ISSUE: No carve-outs for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or IP infringement
         - RECOMMENDATION: Negotiate mutual limitation of liability with carve-outs

      2. **Undefined Scope of Services (Section 1)**
         - RISK: "As requested" provides no clear deliverables or acceptance criteria
         - ISSUE: Could lead to disputes about what was agreed
         - RECOMMENDATION: Add detailed scope, milestones, and acceptance procedures

      ## MODERATE RISK ISSUES

      3. **Extended Payment Terms (Section 2)**
         - RISK: 90-day payment terms are unusually long
         - ISSUE: May indicate vendor cash flow concerns
         - NOTE: Industry standard is typically 30-45 days

      4. **Short Termination Notice (Section 4)**
         - RISK: 7 days may be insufficient for transition
         - ISSUE: Could leave Client without services abruptly
         - RECOMMENDATION: Consider 30-day notice with transition assistance

      5. **Vague Confidentiality (Section 6)**
         - RISK: No definition of confidential information
         - ISSUE: No duration, no exclusions, no remedies specified
         - RECOMMENDATION: Add comprehensive confidentiality terms

      ## MISSING PROVISIONS

      - Intellectual property ownership and work-for-hire provisions
      - Warranties and representations
      - Insurance requirements
      - Dispute resolution mechanism
      - Governing law and jurisdiction
      - Indemnification provisions
      - Force majeure clause

      I've analyzed the vendor services agreement from Client Corp's perspective. Here are the key findings:

      ## High Risk Issues

      **1. Unlimited Liability Waiver**
      Section 5 completely shields the vendor from all liability. This is highly unfavorable for you as the client. You should negotiate:
      - Mutual limitation of liability (e.g., capped at fees paid)
      - Carve-outs for gross negligence, willful misconduct, and IP infringement

      **2. Undefined Scope**
      "Services as requested" is far too vague. Without clear deliverables, you have no recourse if work isn't satisfactory.

      ## Moderate Concerns

      - **90-day payment terms** are unusually long (industry standard: 30-45 days)
      - **7-day termination notice** may leave you without services abruptly
      - **Vague confidentiality** lacks definition, duration, and remedies

      ## Missing Provisions

      The agreement lacks several standard clauses:
      - Intellectual property ownership
      - Warranties and representations
      - Insurance requirements
      - Dispute resolution
      - Governing law
      - Indemnification

      ## Recommendation

      This agreement heavily favors the vendor. I would recommend substantial revisions before signing.

      **Disclaimer**: This is legal information and analysis, not legal advice. Given the significant issues identified, I strongly recommend having a licensed attorney review and negotiate this agreement before execution.

      Would you like me to draft suggested revisions for any specific sections?
