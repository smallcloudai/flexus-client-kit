      LEGAL RESEARCH RESULTS
      Topic: Copyright Protection for AI-Generated Content

      ## 1. US COPYRIGHT LAW - CURRENT STATE

      ### Human Authorship Requirement
      - The Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 102) protects "original works of authorship"
      - Courts have consistently interpreted "authorship" to require a human creator
      - Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53 (1884): established human creative expression as the foundation of copyright
      - Naruto v. Slater, 888 F.3d 418 (9th Cir. 2018): animals cannot hold copyrights; reinforced human authorship requirement

      ### Thaler v. Perlmutter (D.D.C. 2023)
      - Stephen Thaler sought copyright for an image generated entirely by his AI system "Creativity Machine"
      - Court held: works generated autonomously by AI without human creative control are not copyrightable
      - Key quote: "Copyright has never stretched so far as to protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand"
      - Case is on appeal to the D.C. Circuit

      ### US Copyright Office Guidance (February 2023, updated March 2023)
      - Registration guidance for works containing AI-generated material
      - AI-generated content is not copyrightable on its own
      - Works that combine human-authored and AI-generated elements may receive protection for the human-authored portions
      - Applicants must disclose AI-generated content in registration applications
      - The Office will evaluate "whether the AI contributions are the result of mechanical reproduction or instead of an author's own original mental conception"

      ### Zarya of the Dawn Decision (Feb 2023)
      - Kris Kashtanova used Midjourney to generate images for a graphic novel
      - Copyright Office granted copyright for the text and overall arrangement/selection
      - Denied copyright for individual AI-generated images
      - Established spectrum: more human creative control = more copyright protection

      ## 2. THE HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION SPECTRUM

      ### Likely Copyrightable (High Human Input)
      - Human selects, arranges, and modifies AI-generated elements into a new composition
      - Human writes detailed prompts, extensively edits AI output, combines with original work
      - Human uses AI as a tool (like Photoshop) with significant creative direction
      - Substantial post-generation editing, selection, and arrangement

      ### Uncertain Territory
      - Detailed prompting with iterative refinement but minimal post-generation editing
      - Using AI to generate drafts that are moderately revised by humans
      - Curating and selecting from multiple AI outputs

      ### Likely Not Copyrightable (Minimal Human Input)
      - Fully autonomous AI generation with simple prompts
      - Using AI output with no or trivial modifications
      - Single-prompt generation even with detailed instructions (per current Copyright Office position)

      ## 3. EU AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE

      ### EU AI Act (Effective August 2024, phased implementation)
      - Art. 50: Transparency obligations for AI-generated content
      - Providers of AI systems that generate synthetic content must ensure outputs are marked as AI-generated
      - Does not directly address copyright but creates disclosure obligations

      ### EU Copyright Framework
      - InfoSoc Directive 2001/29/EC requires "author's own intellectual creation"
      - CJEU has interpreted this as requiring "free and creative choices" by a natural person
      - Most EU member states align with human authorship requirement
      - UK: Computer-Generated Works provision (CDPA 1988, s.9(3)) uniquely grants copyright to the person who arranged for AI-generated works, but scope is debated

      ### International
      - Berne Convention does not explicitly define "author" but is interpreted to require human creators
      - WIPO Conversation on IP and AI (ongoing): no international consensus yet
      - China: Beijing Internet Court (2023) held that AI-generated images can receive copyright if human has sufficient intellectual investment in prompting and selection
      - India: no specific AI copyright legislation; follows human authorship principle

      ## 4. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL USE

      ### Key Risks
      - AI-generated content without copyright protection can be freely copied by competitors
      - No ability to enforce against infringement of purely AI-generated material
      - Training data liability: AI tools may have been trained on copyrighted works
      - Potential contractual liability if claiming copyright over non-copyrightable works

      ### Risk of AI Training Data Claims
      - Multiple pending lawsuits: Getty v. Stability AI, NYT v. OpenAI, etc.
      - Outcomes could affect commercial viability of AI-generated content
      - Some jurisdictions may impose liability for using tools trained on infringing data

      This is an important and evolving area of law. Here's what your agency needs to know about copyright and AI-generated content.

      ## The Core Principle: Human Authorship Required

      Under current US law, copyright requires a human author. The Copyright Act protects "original works of authorship," and courts have consistently interpreted this to mean human creative expression. In **Thaler v. Perlmutter** (2023), the DC District Court explicitly held that works generated autonomously by AI are not copyrightable.

      ## The Spectrum: It Depends on How You Use AI

      The critical distinction is between *AI-generated* and *AI-assisted* works. The US Copyright Office's **Zarya of the Dawn** decision established a practical framework:

      **Likely Protected** (high human involvement):
      - You use AI to generate raw material, then substantially edit, rearrange, and combine with original work
      - AI serves as a tool (like Photoshop) where human makes the creative decisions
      - Significant post-generation selection, arrangement, and modification

      **Gray Area**:
      - Detailed iterative prompting with moderate editing
      - Curating and selecting from many AI outputs
      - Using AI drafts that are moderately revised

      **Likely Not Protected** (minimal human involvement):
      - Simple prompt, use output as-is
      - Fully autonomous generation with trivial modifications
      - Even detailed single-prompt generation may not qualify per the Copyright Office

      ## What This Means for Your Agency

      **1. Your AI-generated content may not be protectable.** If a competitor copies purely AI-generated marketing copy or images, you may have no copyright claim to assert. This is a significant business risk.

      **2. Document your creative process.** The Copyright Office requires disclosure of AI-generated material in registration applications. Keep records of your prompts, iterations, edits, and human creative choices. The more human involvement you can demonstrate, the stronger your copyright claim.

      **3. Maximize human creative input.** Use AI as a starting point, not the finished product. Substantial editing, selection, arrangement, and combination with original elements strengthens your copyright position.

      **4. Watch for training data liability.** Pending lawsuits (Getty v. Stability AI, NYT v. OpenAI) may affect whether commercial use of AI-generated content carries downstream liability for training data infringement. This is unresolved.

      **5. Client contracts matter.** Be transparent with clients about AI use. If you represent that deliverables are copyrightable and they turn out not to be, you face contractual liability. Consider including AI disclosure clauses.

      ## International Considerations

      - **EU**: The AI Act (2024) requires labeling AI-generated content. Copyright still requires human authorship under the InfoSoc Directive.
      - **UK**: Uniquely, the CDPA s.9(3) grants copyright to the person who "arranged" for computer-generated works -- potentially more favorable, but scope is debated.
      - **China**: A Beijing court (2023) held AI-generated images can receive copyright if there's sufficient human intellectual investment. More permissive than the US.

      ## The Law is Actively Evolving

      Thaler v. Perlmutter is on appeal to the DC Circuit. Congressional hearings on AI and copyright are ongoing. The Copyright Office is developing further guidance. The landscape could shift significantly in the next 1-2 years.

      **Disclaimer**: This is legal research and information, not legal advice. Given the unsettled nature of this law and its direct impact on your agency's business model, I strongly recommend consulting with an IP attorney who can advise on your specific workflows and client agreements.

      Would you like me to research any specific aspect in more depth, such as the training data liability question or international protections?
