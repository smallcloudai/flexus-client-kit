      Great question - non-compete clauses are handled very differently in these two jurisdictions!

      ## California (US)

      California takes an exceptionally employee-friendly stance. Under Business and Professions Code Section 16600, non-compete agreements are **generally void and unenforceable** against employees. Key points:

      - Cannot restrict an employee's ability to work for a competitor after employment ends
      - Narrow exceptions exist only for sale of business or dissolution of partnerships
      - Employers who attempt to enforce void non-competes may face legal consequences
      - This reflects California's strong public policy favoring employee mobility

      ## United Kingdom

      The UK takes a more balanced "reasonableness" approach. Non-competes can be enforceable if they:

      - Protect a **legitimate business interest** (trade secrets, client relationships, workforce stability)
      - Are **reasonable in scope** - limited geography, duration (typically 6-12 months max), and specific activities
      - Are no broader than necessary to protect those interests
      - Courts will scrutinize and may "blue pencil" (modify) overly broad clauses

      ## Key Differences Summary

      | Aspect | California | UK |
      |--------|-----------|-----|
      | Default position | Unenforceable | Enforceable if reasonable |
      | Employee mobility | Strongly protected | Balanced against employer interests |
      | Judicial approach | Void as matter of policy | Case-by-case reasonableness test |

      **Important**: This is general legal information to help you understand the landscape. For advice specific to your situation - whether you're an employer drafting agreements or an employee reviewing one - please consult with a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction.
