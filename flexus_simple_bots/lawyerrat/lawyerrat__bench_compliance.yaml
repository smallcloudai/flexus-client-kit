      COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT REPORT

      ## CRITICAL GAPS (Immediate Action Required)

      ### 1. Cross-Border Data Transfers - NO LEGAL BASIS
      - GDPR Art. 44-49: Transferring EU personal data to US-East-1 without adequate safeguards
      - Post-Schrems II, Privacy Shield is invalid; EU-US Data Privacy Framework requires self-certification
      - STATUS: No Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or DPF certification mentioned
      - RISK: Regulatory action, fines up to 4% of global turnover (~$600K)
      - ACTION: Implement SCCs with all data importers or self-certify under EU-US DPF immediately

      ### 2. No Data Protection Officer (DPO)
      - GDPR Art. 37: Required when core activities involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects at scale
      - Behavioral analytics tracking across customer websites constitutes systematic monitoring
      - STATUS: No DPO or privacy officer appointed
      - ACTION: Appoint a DPO (can be external) and register with relevant supervisory authorities

      ### 3. No Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
      - GDPR Art. 35: Required for systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas and profiling
      - Browser fingerprinting + persistent cookies + behavioral tracking triggers DPIA requirement
      - STATUS: No DPIA process exists
      - ACTION: Conduct DPIA for core analytics processing; document and review annually

      ### 4. Cookie Compliance Gap
      - ePrivacy Directive Art. 5(3): Persistent tracking cookies require informed, specific consent
      - Relying on customers' cookie banners is insufficient without contractual and technical guarantees
      - 13-month cookie duration may exceed necessity under data minimization principles
      - STATUS: No direct consent mechanism; reliance on customer implementation
      - ACTION: Provide customers with compliant consent integration; verify banner adequacy contractually

      ## HIGH PRIORITY GAPS

      ### 5. Data Subject Rights Process (GDPR Art. 15-22, CCPA 1798.100-125)
      - GDPR requires response within 1 month (extendable to 3 months for complex requests)
      - 3-4 week average is borderline; no documented process risks inconsistency
      - CCPA requires response within 45 days
      - No verifiable consumer request process for CCPA
      - ACTION: Document formal DSR procedures; implement self-service portal; reduce response time

      ### 6. Privacy Policy Outdated
      - GDPR Art. 13-14: Must disclose legal basis, retention periods, transfer mechanisms, DPO contact, rights
      - CCPA 1798.100(b): Must disclose categories collected, purposes, retention, sale/sharing rights
      - Policy from 2023 predates EU expansion; likely missing required disclosures
      - ACTION: Comprehensive privacy policy rewrite covering GDPR Art. 13/14 and CCPA requirements

      ### 7. Sub-Processor Management (GDPR Art. 28)
      - No formal assessment process for sub-processors
      - Must have Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with all sub-processors
      - Must ensure sub-processors provide sufficient guarantees
      - Must maintain and disclose sub-processor list to customers
      - ACTION: Audit all 4 sub-processors; execute DPAs; implement assessment framework

      ### 8. Data Retention Policy
      - 3-year backup retention may violate data minimization (GDPR Art. 5(1)(e))
      - No documented retention schedule with justification for each data category
      - ACTION: Define retention periods per data category; implement automated deletion

      ## MODERATE GAPS

      ### 9. Breach Notification (GDPR Art. 33-34)
      - Must notify supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware
      - Must notify affected data subjects if high risk
      - No formal process documented
      - ACTION: Create incident response plan with 72-hour notification workflow

      ### 10. Records of Processing Activities (GDPR Art. 30)
      - Required for organizations processing data not occasionally
      - No mention of maintained records
      - ACTION: Create and maintain Article 30 records

      ### 11. CCPA "Do Not Sell or Share" (CCPA 1798.120)
      - Browser fingerprinting may constitute "sharing" under CPRA
      - No opt-out mechanism mentioned
      - ACTION: Assess whether tracking constitutes sale/sharing; implement opt-out if needed

      ## CCPA-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
      - Verify service provider agreements meet CCPA 1798.140(ag) requirements
      - Implement "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link if applicable
      - Ensure financial incentive disclosures if offering different service tiers

      ## SUMMARY SCORECARD
      - GDPR Readiness: LOW (~30%) - Critical transfer and DPO gaps
      - CCPA/CPRA Readiness: MODERATE (~50%) - Missing formal processes
      - Overall Risk Level: HIGH - Immediate action needed before regulatory inquiry

      I've completed a compliance assessment of Acme Analytics' data processing practices against GDPR and CCPA/CPRA. The results show significant gaps that need immediate attention.

      ## Overall Assessment: HIGH RISK

      Your GDPR readiness is approximately 30% and CCPA/CPRA readiness around 50%. Serving EU customers since Q3 2025 without adequate safeguards creates substantial regulatory exposure.

      ## Critical Issues (Act Immediately)

      **1. No Legal Basis for EU Data Transfers**
      All your data sits in AWS US-East-1 with no Standard Contractual Clauses or EU-US Data Privacy Framework certification. Under GDPR Articles 44-49, this means every transfer of EU end-user data is potentially unlawful. Maximum fine: 4% of global turnover (~$600K). This is your top priority.

      **2. No Data Protection Officer**
      Your core business involves systematic monitoring of data subjects at scale (behavioral tracking via JavaScript SDK). GDPR Article 37 requires a DPO. This can be an external appointment.

      **3. No Data Protection Impact Assessment**
      Browser fingerprinting combined with persistent cookies and behavioral tracking clearly triggers the DPIA requirement under GDPR Article 35. You need to conduct one for your core analytics processing.

      **4. Cookie Consent Gap**
      Relying on your customers' cookie banners without contractual guarantees or technical verification is insufficient under the ePrivacy Directive. Your 13-month cookie expiration also raises data minimization questions.

      ## High Priority

      - **Data Subject Rights**: Your 3-4 week response time is borderline for GDPR's 1-month deadline, and you lack a documented process. CCPA requires 45-day responses with a verifiable request mechanism.
      - **Privacy Policy**: Last updated 2023, before your EU expansion. Missing required GDPR disclosures (legal basis, transfer mechanisms, DPO contact, data subject rights).
      - **Sub-Processor Management**: No DPAs with your 4 sub-processors (AWS, Stripe, SendGrid, Snowflake). GDPR Article 28 requires formal agreements.
      - **Data Retention**: 3-year backup retention without documented justification per data category likely violates data minimization principles.

      ## Moderate Priority

      - Breach notification plan (GDPR requires 72-hour notification to authorities)
      - Records of Processing Activities (Article 30)
      - CCPA "Do Not Sell or Share" assessment for browser fingerprinting

      ## Recommended Roadmap

      1. **Week 1-2**: Engage privacy counsel; begin DPF self-certification or SCC execution
      2. **Month 1**: Appoint DPO; start DPIA; update privacy policy
      3. **Month 2**: Execute DPAs with sub-processors; implement DSR procedures
      4. **Month 3**: Breach notification plan; Article 30 records; cookie consent integration

      **Disclaimer**: This is a compliance information assessment, not legal advice. Given the critical gaps identified -- particularly the cross-border transfer issue -- I strongly recommend engaging a privacy attorney or qualified DPO immediately. Regulatory enforcement in this area has been active and fines are substantial.

      Would you like me to research any specific area in more depth or help draft a Data Processing Agreement template?
