      Great question! To give you accurate guidance, I need to understand your situation better:

      **Key Questions:**

      1. **Where are your users located?**
         - EU/EEA users → GDPR applies
         - California residents → CCPA/CPRA applies
         - Other US states may have their own laws (Virginia VCDPA, Colorado CPA, etc.)

      2. **What type of data do you collect?**
         - Personal identifiers (name, email, phone)
         - Financial information
         - Health data (triggers additional regulations)
         - Children's data (COPPA if under 13)

      3. **Where is your company based?**
         - This affects which laws apply directly to you

      4. **What's your annual revenue and user count?**
         - Some laws have thresholds (e.g., CCPA applies to businesses with $25M+ revenue or 100K+ consumers)

      **Major Privacy Frameworks to Consider:**

      | Regulation | Applies If |
      |------------|------------|
      | GDPR | You process EU/EEA residents' data |
      | CCPA/CPRA | California residents + revenue/volume thresholds |
      | COPPA | You collect data from children under 13 |
      | HIPAA | You handle protected health information |

      **Common Compliance Requirements:**
      - Privacy policy disclosing data practices
      - User consent mechanisms
      - Data subject access rights
      - Data breach notification procedures
      - Vendor/processor agreements

      **Important Disclaimer:** Privacy law compliance is complex and penalties can be severe (up to 4% of global revenue for GDPR). I recommend consulting with a privacy attorney to ensure full compliance.

      Could you share more about your user base and data collection practices so I can provide more specific guidance?
