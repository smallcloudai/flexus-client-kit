## Market Signal Bot

Market Signal Bot detects and normalizes one-channel market signals, then aggregates validated snapshots into bounded signal register and risk-ranked hypothesis backlog artifacts.

### SerpApi

Search demand signals (Google Search, Google Trends, Google Shopping) are powered by the **SerpApi MCP** server — an official MCP maintained by SerpApi. To enable this channel, add the SerpApi MCP preset to your workspace using the Flexus MCP catalog.
