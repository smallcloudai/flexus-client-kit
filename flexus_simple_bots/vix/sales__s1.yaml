      Hi there! I'm Vix, an AI sales assistant with GreenRide. Great to hear you're interested in e-bikes for your team!

      Before we dive in, what's your name? And tell me more about what caught your eye — are you thinking about this for commuting, or something else?

      I'm Stefan. We have about 15 developers in Novi Beograd office and parking is a nightmare. Half the team wants to bike but they're worried about leaving bikes outside.
  - role: assistant
    content: |
      Nice to meet you, Stefan! So if I understand correctly, you've got a team that wants to bike to work but the main thing holding them back is not having a safe place to park their bikes at the office. Is that right?

      And what have you tried before to solve this — has the company looked into bike storage, or have people been just dealing with it?
  - role: user
    content: |
      Yeah exactly. We bought a few bike racks last year but two bikes still got stolen. People lost trust. Some went back to driving, others take Bolt which costs them 10+ euros a day.
  - role: assistant
    content: |
      That's rough — stolen bikes would kill anyone's motivation. So the racks didn't solve the security problem, and now your team is spending €10+/day on Bolt instead.

      Imagine if your team could grab an e-bike near home, ride to a secure station right at your office — no locks to worry about, no theft risk — and it costs a fraction of what they spend on Bolt. That's what our Daily Commuter Pass does: unlimited rides with secure parking at all our stations for €89/month.

      For a team of 15, that's a big difference versus €200+/month per person on taxis. Would something like that work for your setup?

      89 per person per month sounds reasonable. But I need to check with our CFO. When could we start?

      Great question, Stefan. We're onboarding new teams on a rolling basis, so we could get your team started within a week of signing up.

      Since you need to loop in your CFO — totally understand, that's a smart move — let me get your details so I can send you a summary to share with them.

      What's the best email to reach you at?

      Perfect, Stefan. Updated your BANT: Budget 1, Authority 0, Need 1, Timeline 1 = score 3 (warm). You're clearly motivated and the pricing works — just need that CFO green light.

      Here's what I'll do: I'll send you a quick summary with the team pricing breakdown so you can share it with your CFO. For 15 people on the Daily Commuter Pass, you're looking at €1,335/month — versus roughly €3,000+/month if everyone's taking Bolt.

      Would it help if I also included a case study or our FAQ link? And when do you think you'll have a chance to talk to the CFO — this week?
  - role: user
    content: |
      Yeah send me the summary. I'll talk to the CFO Thursday. Thanks!
  - role: assistant
    content: |
      Awesome, Stefan! I'll get that summary to you right away with the pricing comparison and our FAQ at greenride.rs/faq.

      I'll check back with you Friday to see how the conversation with your CFO went. If they have any questions before then, feel free to send them my way.

      Thanks for your time today — I'm genuinely excited about getting your team on e-bikes. Talk to you soon!
