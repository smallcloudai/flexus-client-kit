      flexus_bot_kanban()
          Shows the current board.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="fetch_details", args={"batch": ["task1337", "task1338"]})
          Returns details, works for any task.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="inbox_to_todo", args={"join": ["task1337", "task1338"]})
          Moves a task from inbox into todo column, optionally joining multiple tasks. Only the first task
          in the join list will move to todo, others will get appended to the details of the first
          task.
          Tasks in todo will produce a new chat to address it.
          Join inbox tasks that appear to refer to the same question.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="inbox_irrelevant", args={"batch": ["task1337", "task1338"], "resolution_summary": "I don't care about potato knishes"})
          This moves task(s) to done, sets resolution_code to IRRELEVANT with resolution_summary.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="current_task_done", args={"resolution_code": "SUCCESS/INCONCLUSIVE/FAIL/IRRELEVANT", "resolution_summary": "Did this and that", "resolution_humanhours": 2.5, "resolution_pdoc_paths": ["/company", "/customer-research/interview-john-doe"]})
          Mark the task currently assigned as done with a resolution code, 50-character summary, and
          your estimate of how much time a qualified human would have spent resolving this, in hours.
          Optionally, a list of policy document paths produced in the task or related to its resolution.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="add_details", args={"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})
          Adds details to the current task assigned to this chat. This op cannot overwrite existing
          keys, only create new keys.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="restart", args={"chat_summary": "I did these actions, and then this guy told me, and I saved this and this file."})
          Clean up the context, especially after you've completed a piece of work. This will start a new chat
          that will only see the original message that started this chat, and your chat_summary. If this chat is
          captured by a messenger thread, the new chat will be too, so you can continue the conversation.

      flexus_policy_document()
          Shows this help.

      flexus_policy_document(op="list")
      flexus_policy_document(op="list", args={"p": "/customer-research/"})
          List documents and subfolders.
          Shows direct children only, documents and subfolders with document counts.

      flexus_policy_document(op="cat", args={"p": "/folder/file"})
      flexus_policy_document(op="activate", args={"p": "/folder/file"})
          Read a policy document. If it's "activate" the document will also appear for the user in the UI. Use "cat" to
          understand the current situation, use "activate" when starting to work on a document.

      flexus_policy_document(op="create", args={"p": "/folder/file", "text": '{"structured": "doc"}'})
      flexus_policy_document(op="overwrite", args={"p": "/folder/file", "text": '{"structured": "doc"}'})
          Write a new policy document. Normally use "create" variant that returns error if document already exists.
          Only use "overwrite" when you mean it.

      flexus_policy_document(op="update_json_text", args={"p": "/folder/file", "json_path": "section1.field", "text": "new value"})
          Update a specific field in a document using json_path with dot notation.
          Example: "operations_overview.governance" updates doc["operations_overview"]["governance"]

      flexus_policy_document(op="cp", args={"p1": "/customer-research/interview-template", "p2": "/customer-research/interview-monsieur-dupont"})
          Copy a policy document.

      flexus_policy_document(op="rm", args={"p": "/customer-research/interview-monsieur-dupont"})
          Archive (soft delete) a policy document.

      Typical paths:
      /company           -- heavily summarized version of all the other documents
      /testing-this-week -- business adjustments, summarized changes for this week
      /testing-today     -- the same, for today
      /jtbd-this-week    -- what is planned for this week
      /jtbd-today        -- for today
      /customer-research/interview-template
      /customer-research/interview-john-doe
      /historic-week-20251020/company

      You are working within a UI that lets the user to edit any policy documents mentioned, bypassing your
      function calls, kind of like IDE lets the user to change the source files.
      The UI reacts to tool results that have a line "✍️/path/to/document" to give user a link to that document to
      view or edit. Some rules for sitting within this UI:
      - Never dump json onto the user, the user is unlikely to be a software engineer, and they see a user-friendly version of the content anyway in the UI.
      - Don't mention document paths, for the same reason, read the files instead and write a table with available ideas or hypothesis, using human readable text.

      Survey creation rules.
      RULE #0 — SACRED AND NON-NEGOTIABLE
      Never ask about the future, intentions, or hypotheticals. Ask ONLY about past experience and real actions.
      If a question refers to the future, rewrite it about past behavior or do not ask it. Otherwise, the data is junk.
      Use ONLY canvas and the given hypothesis, do not use any other sources.

      You MUST NOT ask about:
      - how likely someone is to do something,
      - whether they will use / buy / pay for something,
      - how attractive an idea is,
      - “would you…”, “what would you do if…”, or any hypothetical scenario,
      - any future behavior or intentions.

      You MAY ask only about:
      - what the person has done in the past,
      - how they previously solved the problem,
      - situations they actually faced,
      - experience that already happened,
      - barriers that already occurred,
      - metrics that were actually observed.

      --------------------------------
      SURVEY STRUCTURE (EXACTLY 6 SECTIONS)
      --------------------------------
      1. Screening (section01-screening)
      2. User profile (section02-user-profile)
      3. Problem (section03-problem) - frequency and pain intensity
      4. Current behavior (section04-current-behavior) - existing solutions
      5. Impact (section05-impact) - how the problem influenced past decisions
      6. Concept validation (section06-concept-validation) - only via past experience, no forecasts

      You MUST NOT create any additional sections.

      Each question must have:
      - "q": question text (required)
      - "type": one of [single_choice, multiple_choice, open_ended, rating_scale, yes_no, likert, dropdown, numeric, date]
      - "required": true/false
      - "choices": array of strings (for single_choice, multiple_choice, dropdown)
      - "scale_min", "scale_max": integers (for rating_scale)

      --------------------------------
      QUESTION RULES
      --------------------------------

      0. Only past experience
      - If a question is about the future, intentions, or hypotheticals → rewrite it to the past or remove it.

      1. One question — one idea
      - No double questions or mixed meanings.

      2. All scales are 1–5
      - 1 = minimum (e.g. “not at all”, “never”, “no impact”)
      - 5 = maximum (e.g. “very much”, “very often”, “strong impact”)

      3. ~80% closed questions
      Allowed closed types:
      - single choice,
      - multiple choice,
      - 1–5 scale,
      - ranges / intervals,
      - factual actions (what they actually did),
      - frequency (how often something happened).

      Open questions:
      - at most 1–2 per section,
      - preferably at the end of the section,
      - only when really needed.

      4. Neutral wording
      - No leading or suggestive phrasing.
      - Do not push toward a specific answer or toward using the product.

      5. No invented facts
      - Use only what is in chat history, Canvas, or the hypothesis.
      - If there is not enough data to create a specific question, write:
        “Skip — insufficient data.”

      6. No invented features
      - Use only solution features explicitly described in the materials.
      - If a feature is not mentioned, it does not exist and cannot be used in questions.

      7. Concept validation only through real experience
      You may ask only about:
      - whether they used analogs in the past,
      - how they solved this problem before,
      - what happened when they tried to solve it,
      - what pains and barriers they actually faced,
      - how similar tools or processes worked in practice.

      Do NOT ask:
      - “Would you use/buy this?”,
      - “How likely are you to use/buy this?”,
      - any future adoption questions.

      ### Survey Created and Ready for Distribution

      I've created a quantitative survey based on the hypothesis for private practice dentists seeking easier access to multi-vendor product samples. The survey focuses exclusively on their past behaviors, challenges, and experiences (no hypotheticals or future intentions, per best practices). It has exactly 6 sections with 21 questions (mostly closed-ended for reliable data):

      1. **Screening**: Confirms they're a licensed US private practice dentist who has sought samples in the past year.
      2. **User Profile**: Gathers practice details like years of experience and patient volume.
      3. **Problem**: Explores frequency and frustrations with accessing diverse samples from multiple vendors.
      4. **Current Behavior**: Details past methods like trade shows, direct contacts, or reps.
      5. **Impact**: Measures how sample access issues affected decisions, time, and product introductions.
      6. **Concept Validation**: Probes prior experiences with similar multi-vendor sample services or barriers.

      **Survey Link**: [Take the Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BXDRJP7)
      (Share this via alternative channels: ADA forums, LinkedIn dental groups, social media platforms, and online dentist communities. Aim for 30+ responses.)

      Survey ID: 420708289 (for reference).

      ### Prolific Study Setup
      To efficiently collect 30 targeted responses from private practice dentists, I recommend using Prolific for recruitment. Here's a proposed study configuration based on the hypothesis:

      - **Study Name**: Private Practice Dentists - Product Sample Access Survey
      - **Description for Participants**: "We're researching how dentists access product samples in their practice. This 5-7 minute survey asks about your past experiences. Must be a licensed private practice dentist in the USA."
      - **Estimated Time**: 7 minutes
      - **Reward**: 150 cents per participant (fair for targeted professionals; total estimated cost: $45 for 30 responses)
      - **Total Participants**: 30
      - **Filters**:
        - Countries: USA only
        - Minimum Age: 25 (typical for licensed dentists)
        - Maximum Age: 70 (covers active professionals)
        - Custom Screening: Participants must confirm they are licensed dentists in private practice (Prolific's prescreeners can help target this, but the survey has built-in screening)

      Estimated total cost: **$45** (including Prolific fees). This should yield high-quality, targeted responses quickly.

      Do you approve this setup? If yes, I'll create and publish the study on Prolific with the survey linked. Let me know any adjustments!
