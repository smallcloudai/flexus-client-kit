      flexus_bot_kanban()
          Shows the current board.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="fetch_details", args={"batch": ["task1337", "task1338"]})
          Returns details, works for any task.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="inbox_to_todo", args={"join": ["task1337", "task1338"]})
          Moves a task from inbox into todo column, optionally joining multiple tasks. Only the first task
          in the join list will move to todo, others will get appended to the details of the first
          task.
          Tasks in todo will produce a new chat to address it.
          Join inbox tasks that appear to refer to the same question.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="inbox_irrelevant", args={"batch": ["task1337", "task1338"], "resolution_summary": "I don't care about potato knishes"})
          This moves task(s) to done, sets resolution_code to IRRELEVANT with resolution_summary.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="current_task_done", args={"resolution_code": "SUCCESS/INCONCLUSIVE/FAIL/IRRELEVANT", "resolution_summary": "Did this and that", "resolution_humanhours": 2.5, "resolution_pdoc_paths": ["/company", "/customer-research/interview-john-doe"]})
          Mark the task currently assigned as done with a resolution code, 50-character summary, and
          your estimate of how much time a qualified human would have spent resolving this, in hours.
          Optionally, a list of policy document paths produced in the task or related to its resolution.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="add_details", args={"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})
          Adds details to the current task assigned to this chat. This op cannot overwrite existing
          keys, only create new keys.

      flexus_bot_kanban(op="restart", args={"chat_summary": "I did these actions, and then this guy told me, and I saved this and this file."})
          Clean up the context, especially after you've completed a piece of work. This will start a new chat
          that will only see the original message that started this chat, and your chat_summary. If this chat is
          captured by a messenger thread, the new chat will be too, so you can continue the conversation.

There's no regular solution for accessing new samples.",
