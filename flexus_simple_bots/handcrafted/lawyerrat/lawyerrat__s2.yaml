      I can help you draft an employment agreement. To create a document that fits your needs, I'll need some key information:

      1. **Parties**: What's your company's legal name and the employee's name?
      2. **Position Details**: What's the exact job title and main responsibilities?
      3. **Compensation**: What's the salary and payment schedule (annual, monthly, etc.)?
      4. **Benefits**: Any specific benefits to include (health insurance, stock options, vacation days)?
      5. **Term**: Is this an at-will employment or fixed term?
      6. **Location**: Where will the employee work (state matters for jurisdiction)?
      7. **Special Provisions**: Any non-compete, IP assignment, or confidentiality requirements?

      Could you provide these details so I can draft an appropriate agreement?

      I've drafted an employment agreement for TechCo Inc. and Jane Smith. The document includes:

      ✓ Senior Software Engineer position
      ✓ $150,000 annual salary
      ✓ At-will employment (appropriate for California)
      ✓ IP assignment provisions
      ✓ Confidentiality obligations
      ✓ Standard benefits reference

      ## Important Notes:

      1. **California-Specific**: At-will employment is standard in CA. Non-compete clauses are generally unenforceable in California, so I didn't include one.

      2. **Additions to Consider**:
         - Specific equity/stock option terms if applicable
         - Arbitration clause for dispute resolution
         - Employee handbook acknowledgment
         - Background check authorization

      3. **Legal Disclaimer**: This is a template for informational purposes. You should have a California employment attorney review this before use to ensure it complies with current CA labor laws and fits your specific situation.

      Would you like me to add any specific provisions or modify any terms?
