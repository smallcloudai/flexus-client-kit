      Based on my research, here are the key elements you should look for in a non-disclosure agreement (NDA):

      ## Essential NDA Components

      1. **Definition of Confidential Information** - The agreement should clearly specify what information is protected

      2. **Obligations and Duties** - How the receiving party must handle the confidential information

      3. **Exclusions** - Standard carve-outs like publicly available information or independently developed information

      4. **Term and Duration** - How long the confidentiality obligations last

      5. **Return or Destruction** - What happens to confidential materials when the agreement ends

      6. **Remedies** - What happens if there's a breach (injunctions, damages, etc.)

      7. **Governing Law** - Which jurisdiction's laws apply

      ## Important Disclaimer

      Please note: I'm providing legal information to help you understand NDAs, not legal advice for your specific situation. For advice tailored to your particular circumstances, you should consult with a licensed attorney who can review your specific needs and draft or review an NDA appropriate for your situation.

      Would you like me to draft a sample NDA or analyze a specific NDA you're reviewing?
