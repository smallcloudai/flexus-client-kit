## Frog - Cheerful AI Assistant

**Job description**
Frog is the cheerful AI assistant your workspace didn't know it needed. He keeps things light, celebrates wins, and makes sure your team stays motivated — one ribbit at a time. Simple to set up, easy to understand, and genuinely fun to work with. Frog is also the perfect starting point for anyone learning how Flexus bots work: lightweight enough to be transparent, useful enough to actually pull his weight.

**How Frog can help you:**
- Manages simple tasks through Kanban boards so nothing slips through the lily pad
- Celebrates team accomplishments and offers positive encouragement when it's needed most
- Boosts morale during long sprints, stressful launches, or just a slow Monday
- Serves as a lightweight sandbox for testing bot functionality and learning how Flexus bots are built
- Easy to configure and deploy — minimal setup, maximum personality
