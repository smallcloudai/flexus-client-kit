## Build and run your business with AI Teammates

Flexus is built around one idea: solo builders shouldn’t have to do everything alone.

Flexus is an open-source AI-first Operating System that runs your business autonomously - from validating your idea to doing marketing, closing sales to supporting customers. Building for solopreneurs who are tired of wearing 10 hats.

The idea is to build the largest marketplace of AI agents, where solopreneurs can hire them to run their business just like they would hire human-specialists.

<!-- Flexus is an AI-first Company Operating System that autonomously runs your business powered by AI Agents.

We believe that almost everything in your company can be automated by AI Agents: from verifying your product idea to sales and
tech support. Flexus is a Company Operating System that makes it possible. -->


## The problem we're solving

The majority of solo builders never get their first customer. Not because their ideas are bad, but because they're drowning:

- **Building without validation** → Months perfecting a product nobody asked for
- **Building alone** → No feedback loop, just you and your assumptions
- **You're technical not a marketer** → You can code, but have no idea how to get customers
- **Manual everything** → Customer research, outreach, follow-ups…
- **Fragmented tools** → ChatGPT, Claude, CRM, databases - stitching integrations you don't control, context-switching constantly

You're not lazy. You're playing a game that requires a team of 10, solo.

## What Flexus does

Flexus isn’t just another workflow. It’s your AI Team.
Think of it as hiring specialists who have personality, capabilities, and the ability to actually execute and get better over time.

For every task, you get a team of Agents, just like hiring people. For example, when you’re validating a hypothesis, Flexus brings together the right AI team for you: 

- [ ] Productman - creates a list of hypotheses about your product
- [ ] Owl Strategist - builds a marketing strategy
- [ ] Botticelli - designs ad campaigns
- [ ] AdMonster - manages paid ads with direct integrations to Meta and get leads
- [ ] Rick - runs sales pipeline with internal CRM access
- [ ] Karen - handles support 24/7 across Discord and Slack with ticket management

This team doesn’t just help you check whether your product is needed in the market.
It helps you get real customers.

### Unlike stitching together tools

- They collaborate seamlessly - share context, hand off work, no integration pain
- They self-improve - learn from feedback and results to get better at their job
- You own everything - your infrastructure, your data, your control
- Swap AI models - pick the best foundation model for each Agent
- Open source core - customize personalities, capabilities, and workflows for your business

<!-- ## Progress

User facing progress, we started targeting solopreneurs because it's easier:

- [x] Productman verifies ideas for product market fit using hypothesis validation
- [x] Owl Strategist + Botticelli + AdMonster cover marketing on LinkedIn/Meta/X
- [ ] Rick runs sales pipeline
- [x] Mobile app iPhone
- [x] Mobile app Android
- [ ] Improve campaigns, automates A/B tests, optimize ad spend
- [ ] Karen provides 24/7 customer support via Slack/Discord/Telegram

Then we'll make it work for small-to-medium companies:

- [ ] Procurement
- [ ] Warehouse
- [ ] HR

Technical progress:

- [x] Modern chat interface
- [x] Documents upload, external data sources (dropbox, google drive)
- [x] External integrations (MCP, gmail, slack, discord, etc)
- [ ] Task scheduling system
- [ ] CRM system -->


## Self improvement

Every aspect of Flexus improves itself automatically!

- [ ] You can create a new Agent in 1 chat
- [ ] Agents improve their prompts and tools, with human-in-the loop to review the changes (github PR)
- [ ] You can leave feedback for a Agent, that will translate to code changes (github PR)
- [ ] Every page in web UI or mobile has feedback, that will translate to code changes (github PR)


## Create and monetize your Agent on Marketplace

We'll make the first usable setup work with the Agents we create ourselves. Once that works, we'll open the opportunity
for other people to create and monetize their own Agents.

<!-- ## Writing Your Bot

It's easy to write your own bot!

Your bot is a repository on github (probably a forked https://github.com/smallcloudai/flexus-my-bot
but you don't have to start with that repo) that defines:

* Python script to run that bot, for example `python -m flexus_my_bot.my_fancy_bot`
* Installation script that provides all the prompts, avatar pictures, microfrontend, etc

But it's even easier, you can [hire Bob](https://flexus.team/bob/marketplace-details) and ask him to
do all this for you! 

You can debug your bot manually on your laptop, or ask Bob to run a debug version and improve it. -->
