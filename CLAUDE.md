Coding Style
------------

Don't ever write stupid comments, like "calling function f" and the next line f().

Be careful to write short code, important to not have a lot of lines or messy lines, simple code is great.

Don't write docstrings. Docstrings are silly, unless you are explaining something really really clever which rarely happens.

Prioritize code simplicity. Simplicity beats docstrings every time.

Don't create temporary variables for no reason, if you can easily inline the value to whatever it needs it, do it.

Don't split into many lines things that can be more readable in just one that is not super long.

Comments should appear for:

 * Tricks
 * Hacks
 * Ugliness
 * Places for future improvement, should start with XXX
 * Facts hard to grasp just by looking at code (python duck typing!)

This project uses prefixes in naming, especially for data schema fields.
For example `fgroup_name` is a name for a group in Flexus. It's not the same as `name` which can refer to a name of anything,
and it's not searchable, meaning you can't trace it to its usages everywhere including JavaScript.
Always prefer names with prefixes over generic names, including parameter names and external GraphQL interfaces.

Local variables should, in most cases, be short to prioritize code size and readability, but still make sense and be clear. If code gets messy, use variable name length as a tool to visually distinguish between short-lived
truly local variables and ugly/clever variables that persist on the stack for a long time -- give them a longer name.

Formatting for python, screw the PEP8:

def my_func(
    x: int,
    y: int,
) -> int:
    return x + y

my_func(
    5,
    6,
)

Notice the trailing commas and indent independent of brackets position on the previous line.

For imports, prefer `import xxx` and `xxx.f()` over `from xxx import f` and `f()`. The goal here is to make code locally
readable, so you know where "f" comes from. This rule applies to Flexus own modules and libraries it uses, but does not
apply to very standard python things like "from typing import Any" because "typing.Any" everywhere would not make
readability any better, and you know where Any comes from anyway.

Good example: "from flexus_client_kit import ckit_shutdown" then in code "ckit_shutdown.wait(30)".


Another stupid idea is to define:

MY_CONSTANT = "my_constant"

...and then use MY_CONSTANT as if it was a huge improvement over just using "my_constant". It's not better it's worse,
because a search for "\bmy_constant\b" will not find all its usages. Use strings in code directly.

Good formatting for python graphql client code:

await http_session.execute(gql.gql("""
    mutation WhoCallsAndWhy($input: SomeInputType!) {
        real_name(input: $input) { ... }
    }"""),
    variable_values={
        "input": {
            ...
        }
    },
)

Note WhoCallsAndWhy appears in the backend logs in addition to real_name, so it's clear why the call was necessary, and it's
searchable as well.
